install dependencies with
```
sh install_dependencies.sh
```
this will also create a virtual environment keeping your system clean, because the dependencies will not be installed in root, but in virtual environment folder called "venv".
Open the terminal and activate the virtual environment with
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
run the script in the same terminal with
```
python workout-tracker.py
```
